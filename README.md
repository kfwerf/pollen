A FitBit app that will try to display pollen related updates in your area.

# Description on FitBit
A simple app that tries to check what the pollen situation is in your area. It will try to find pollens for tree, grass and weeds.

This app uses the great ClimaCell, https://www.climacell.co/ APIs for getting the pollen data. It is in no way affiliated with ClimaCell, just a small app that utilizes their great APIs.

NOTE: Initial location can take a bit of time to get, it works better when outside. Be patient with it's initial 'finding you' operation. It might take a few minutes.

# Using companion and the watch
It does most of the work on the companion for tracking and its pretty slow with the GPS. Artwork and such are created in Sketch.
